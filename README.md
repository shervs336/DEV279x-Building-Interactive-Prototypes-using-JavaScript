-------------------------------------------------------------------

###**Introduction**

This code serves as reference to the exercises done in through [this](https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:Microsoft+DEV279x+2T2017/course/) course taken from [edx.org](https://edx.org). I just want to share what I have experience and made sure that others can use my own creation for their reference as well.
